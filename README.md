# Contact Particle Filter

This repo implements the [contact particle filter](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Manuelli16.pdf).
It uses [OSQP](https://osqp.org) for solving QPs quickly, and [pyembree](https://github.com/scopatz/pyembree) for fast CPU-based line-mesh intersection.
